* eradio
This is just like [[https://github.com/fossegrim/eradio][fossegrim/eradio]] but I added some (half-baked) features that I use, like:
- A function that plays a random radio
- A way to get currently playing song name (only works with mpv)
- Some commands to show/log song names in emacs/file

See [[https://github.com/isamert/dotfiles/blob/master/.emacs.d/settings.org#eradio][my emacs configuration for eradio]] more info.
